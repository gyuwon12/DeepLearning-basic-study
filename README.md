# Introduction

Welcome to the Deep Learning Study repository! 
This repository is designed to provide resources and code for learning and implementing deep learning models in the fields of computer vision and natural language processing. 
Whether you are a beginner or an experienced practitioner, this repository aims to support your journey in understanding and applying deep learning concepts.

# Examples

To help you get started, this repository includes three main projects, each focusing on a different type of deep learning model. Explore the following projects to gain hands-on experience and insights:

1. CNN
2. RNN
3. Encoder-Decoder

# Projects

# CNN
The CNN project introduces modern convolutional neural network models. The code is organized into three components: train, model, and dataset. The dataset used is FashionMNIST, and the available model types include:
- AlexNet
- VGG
- NiN
- GoogleNet
- ResNet
- DenseNet

Explore the CNN project to learn and implement these state-of-the-art CNN models for computer vision tasks.

# RNN
The RNN project focuses on modern recurrent neural network models. Similar to the CNN project, the code is organized into three components: train, model, and dataset. The dataset used in this project is 'timemachine.txt'. The available model types for recurrent neural networks include:
- RNN
- LSTM
- GRU
- BiLSTM
- BiGRU

Dive into the RNN project to understand and apply these models for natural language processing tasks.

# Encoder-Decoder
The Encoder-Decoder project delves into models with encoder and decoder structures. The code is divided into train, model, dataset, and util components. The dataset used is a collection of 'English -> French' corpus datasets conducted by the Tatoeba Project. The model types covered in this project are:
- Seq2Seq
- Seq2Seq with Attention
- Transformer

The Transformer model is particularly important in this project. To enhance the implementation of the Transformer, various attention mechanisms and methods are implemented in the utils.py file. Make sure to explore and understand these components thoroughly.

Feel free to explore each project directory and leverage the provided code and resources to deepen your understanding of deep learning in computer vision and natural language processing.
